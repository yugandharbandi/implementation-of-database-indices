1. Create the datasets and blocks using Dataset_creation.cpp
2. After creating them do the experiments according tot the theta value
3. In Index_Evaluation.cpp we just have to change the value of Theta for two experiments
4. for one value of Theta all the a's or b's of experiments get completed
5. Number of diskblocks read for each experiment is stored in the file Experiment_#Theta.txt in the following order noindex,bitmap,rowid,bitslice
For Theta = 3000 it takes a lot of time
For seeing whether all the files are read or not remove the comments of the couts whic are in the code
